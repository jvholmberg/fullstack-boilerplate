# Fullstack Boilerplate
TODO: Write a project description
## Installation
1. Clone repo using `git clone`
2. Install neccessary 3:rd party libraries `npm install && bower install`
3. Start a local webserver by running `gulp`

## Usage
I'm doing my best to separate out components to minimize coupling between components.
In theory it should be as easy to add/remove wanted/unwanted functionality.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
